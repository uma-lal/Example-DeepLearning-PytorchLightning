# Deep Learning with Pytorch Lightning


## Description

This is a toy example that shows the basic code structure for training a Deep Learning model for a classification task.

Specifically, it shows how to train a basic 3D ResNet for a brain classification task using Pytorch Lightning. 


## Methodology

[Pytorch Lightning](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/stable/starter/introduction.html) framework will be used for this project.

The code is organized in different modules:

- Data Module (/data-module)
- MOdels Module (/models-module)
- Main Module (/main-module)

The information of a toy dataset is stored in the following file:
- data-info.csv

The packages required for running the code are listed in:
- requirements.txt

To install them in your virtual enviroment type:
- pip install -r requirements.txt
