# Deep Learning with Pytorch Lightning


## Description
*** 

This toy example shows the basic code structure for of a Deep Learning classification task.

Specifically, it shows how to train a basic 3D ResNet for a brain classification task using Pytorch Lightning. 


## Methodology
*** 

[Pytorch Lightning](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/stable/starter/introduction.html) framework will be used for this project.

The code is organized in different modules:

- Data Module (/data-module)
- MOdels Module (/models-module)
- Main Module (/main-module)

We also have the information of a toy dataset:
